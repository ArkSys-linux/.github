## Why to choose this system?
After installing multiple Linux distros with different desktop environments (DE) and  window managers (WM), I always end up with a similar configuration and visual design. So this is the type of OS that I recommend to use in a daily drive for most computers.

## [Kernel = Linux](https://kernel.org/)
I have chosen Linux as the Operating System beacause is the biggest open-source project, is private, secure, very customazible and there is a big community that can help you. Also it is the only one that can compite against the proprietary system such as Windows and macOS. And in case you don't know, Linux is only the Kernel of the Operating System that communicates with the computer hardware, the rest of the OS is constructed on top of that.

## Linux distribution = [Arch-Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
The Linux distro is a configured system with a customized Linux Kernel plus basic software libraries and a package manager, sometimes can include a DE or WM. 

I chose Arch Linux:
- Very lightway distro, only 300 packages preinstalled which occupies 800 MiB of size
- Perfect distro if you want to configure your system and learn in the process.
- Great documentation in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
- Second biggest community of Linux after Debian (Ubuntu is based on Debian)
- Carried by the community and not by any propietary enterprise.
- Package manager **pacman** very useful 
- Two big repository with thousands of packages, [arch packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/) maintained by the arch developers and the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) maintained by the community.
- Distributed servers around the world that work as mirror servers.
- Rolling-release model, continuous delivery updates for software applications.

There are others distributions like Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), Fedora, openSUSE, Slackware, Alpine Linux, Void Linux... But Arch is simple focusing on learning and very customasible that features the last packages with its model rolling-release.

## Desktop Environment = [KDE](https://kde.org/)
Most of us are familiar with Windows or perhaps MacOS before using Linux, and these operating systems are great in terms of usability, but not for privacy. To achieve a similar design very customizable and good workflow, the best option is to use a desktop environment such as KDE (K Desktop Environment) or something more simple like GNOME or XFCE. 

KDE is under development and is the biggest open-source project that develop free user applications.

This project is similar to [CachyOS KDE](https://github.com/CachyOS/), [Garuda Linux KDE-lite](https://iso.builds.garudalinux.org/iso/garuda/kde-lite/), [Xerolinux KDE](https://github.com/xerolinux)
