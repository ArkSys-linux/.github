***ArkSys*** an **Ar**ch Linux with **K** Desktop Environment as a **Sys**tem.

Similar to [CachyOS KDE](https://github.com/CachyOS/), [Garuda Linux KDE-lite](https://iso.builds.garudalinux.org/iso/garuda/kde-lite/) and [Xerolinux KDE](https://github.com/xerolinux).

## Why to choose this system?
After installing multiple Linux distros with different desktop environments (DE) and  window managers (WM), I always end up with a similar configuration and visual design. So this is the type of OS that I recommend to use in a daily drive for most computers.

## [Kernel = Linux](https://kernel.org/)
I have chosen Linux as the Operating System beacause is the biggest open-source project, is private, secure, very customazible and there is a big community that can help you. Also it is the only one that can compite against the proprietary system such as Windows and macOS. And in case you don't know, Linux is only the Kernel of the Operating System that communicates with the computer hardware, the rest of the OS is constructed on top of that.

## Linux distribution = [Arch-Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
Linux distro = customized Linux Kernel + basic utilities + package manager + WM/DE/terminal

I chose Arch Linux by these reasons:
- Very lightway ISO (around 300 packages preinstalled and 800 MiB of size)
- 2nd biggest community of Linux after Debian/Ubuntu.
- Perfect distro to learn and configure your system.
- Two big repository with thousands of packages, [arch](https://archlinux.org/packages/) and [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)
- Distributed mirror servers with Arch repository packages.
- Useful package manager, **pacman**.
- Great documentation in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
- Rolling-release model.

There are other distributions like Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), Fedora, openSUSE, Slackware, Alpine Linux, Void Linux...

## Desktop Environment = [KDE](https://kde.org/)
Most of us are familiar with Windows or perhaps MacOS before using Linux, and these operating systems are great in terms of usability, but not for privacy. To achieve a similar design very customizable and good workflow, the best option is to use a desktop environment such as KDE (K Desktop Environment) or something more simple like GNOME or XFCE. 

KDE is under development and is the biggest open-source project that develop free user applications.
